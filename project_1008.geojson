For this reason, it is common for people to sleep outside in tent cities in open areas of the city (soccer fields, school yards, etc).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this task is to map these tent city locations to help responders on the ground supply them with food, water, and medical care as needed.

For each campsite you find, draw an area around the entire campsite and tag it with the following tags:\r\n\r\n* **idp:camp_site=spontaneous_camp**\r\n* **damage:event=nepal_earthquake_2015**\r\n* **source=Pleiades 2015-04-27, CNES, Airbus DS**\r\n\r\nPLEASE reference the \r\n[Nepal Earthquake - IDP Collection Guidance](http://hotosm.github.io/tracing-guides/guide/Nepal.html#IDP Collection Guidance)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best procedure to follow is to scan through the Pleiades image until you think you have found a campsite, and then switch to the Bing imagery to see it before the quake and determine its status. It is even better to use 2014-11-29 Pleiades image for comparison, whose URL for JOSM is:\r\ntms[23]:http://imagery.openstreetmap.fr/tms/1.0.0/kathmandu_pleiades_20141129/{zoom}/{x}/{y}\r\n(same license). \r\n\r\nYou can easily show or hide imagery layers in JOSM by pressing alt+NUMBER, where NUMBER is the number of the layer, starting with 1 at the bottom of the list and counting up from there, so alt+3 will show/hide the third layer from the bottom.", "validated": 64.44, "name": "Nepal Earthquake, 2015, IDP Camps in Kathmandu"}}
