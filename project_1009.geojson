You can find remote hamlets very isolated from the rest of villages. When you find hamlets, assure that a path or road connects to this residential area.\r\n\r\nOften in the mountains, only paths exist. Trace these paths and assure to connect them to the road network.\r\n\r\n**Do not trace all the paths in the fields or small paths of a few hundred meters that do not connect to road networks**. This makes it more difficult to read the map and identify the important paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n**Imagery Detail**\r\n\r\nThis imagery is from Digital Globe\u2019s WorldView-2 satellite taken from multiple images acquired in 2013 and 2015. The northern section was shot on 25 Nov 2013 and the southern sections were shot on April 2015. The images are orthorectified for terrain corrected geographic precision. Additionally, the images have been contrast stretched using a custom stretch and processed into a Tiled Map Service (TMS) for performance.\r\n\r\n    \r\n**Road tagging guide**\r\n\r\nFrom [Nepal roads page on the wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nepal/Roads)\r\n\r\n- highway=primary Road corridors that carries a huge volume of traffic between arterial roads and has a high density of public transport services. These roads often connect two relatively distant localities in urban areas. \r\n- highway=secondary Collector roads that carry lower volume of traffic and has either no public transport service or a lower density of public transport service. These roads often connect two neighboring/nearby localities in urban areas. \r\n- highway=road Roads traced from satellite imagery for which a classification has not been determined yet. This is a temporary tag indicating further ground survey work is required.\t\t\t\r\n- highway=residential General residential roads in a planned locality. Wide enough to carry slow moving residential traffic. \r\n- highway=service Generally for access to (or inside) a building, industrial estate, universities, parks, etc. \r\n- highway=pedestrian Roads that are almost exclusively used by pedestrians and are out of bounds of motor vehicles in normal conditions, such as plazas and squares.\t\t\r\n- highway=track Unpaved motorable tracks \r\n\r\nAlso, look out for pedestrian suspension bridges. They are common and [can look like this](https://twitter.com/pedrito1414/status/591976319153524738).
