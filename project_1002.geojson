These roads often connect two neighboring/nearby localities in urban areas. \r\n- highway=road Roads traced from satellite imagery for which a classification has not been determined yet. This is a temporary tag indicating further ground survey work is required.\t\t\t\r\n- highway=residential General residential roads in a planned locality. Wide enough to carry slow moving residential traffic. \r\n- highway=service Generally for access to (or inside) a building, industrial estate, universities, parks, etc. \r\n- highway=pedestrian Roads that are almost exclusively used by pedestrians and are out of bounds of motor vehicles in normal conditions, such as plazas and squares.\t\t\r\n- highway=track Unpaved motorable tracks \r\n\r\nAlso, look out for pedestrian suspension bridges.
