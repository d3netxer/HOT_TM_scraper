You can find remote hamlets very isolated from the rest of villages. When you find hamlets,assure that a path or road connect to this residential area.\r\n\r\nOften in the mountains, only paths exist. Trace these paths and assure to connect them to the road network.\r\n\r\n**Do not trace all the paths in the fields or small paths of a few hundred meters that do not connect to road networks**. This make more difficult to read the map and identify the important paths.\r\n\r\n**Imagery (Bing or MapBox) **\r\n\r\n    Note that Bing has higher resolution.

These roads often connect two relatively distant localities in urban areas. \r\n- highway=secondary Collector roads that carry lower volume of traffic and has either no public transport service or a lower density of public transport service. These roads often connect two neighboring/nearby localities in urban areas. \r\n- highway=road Roads traced from satellite imagery for which a classification has not been determined yet. This is a temporary tag indicating further ground survey work is required.\t\t\t\r\n- highway=residential General residential roads in a planned locality. Wide enough to carry slow moving residential traffic. \r\n- highway=service Generally for access to (or inside) a building, industrial estate, universities, parks, etc. \r\n- highway=pedestrian Roads that are almost exclusively used by pedestrians and are out of bounds of motor vehicles in normal conditions, such as plazas and squares.\t\t\r\n- highway=track Unpaved motorable tracks \r\n\r\nAlso, look out for pedestrian suspension bridges. They are common and [can look like this](https://twitter.com/pedrito1414/status/591976319153524738).
