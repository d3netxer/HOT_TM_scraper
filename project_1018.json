Often in the mountains, only paths exist. Trace these paths and assure to connect them to the road network.\r\n\r\n**Do not trace all the paths in the fields or small paths of a few hundred meters that do not connect to road networks**. This make more difficult to read the map and identify the important paths.\r\n\r\nFrom [Nepal roads page on the wiki](http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Nepal/Roads)\r\n\r\n- highway=primary Road corridors that carries a huge volume of traffic between arterial roads and has a high density of public transport services. These roads often connect two relatively distant localities in urban areas. \r\n- highway=secondary Collector roads that carry lower volume of traffic and has either no public transport service or a lower density of public transport service. These roads often connect two neighboring/nearby localities in urban areas. \r\n- highway=road Roads traced from satellite imagery for which a classification has not been determined yet. This is a temporary tag indicating further ground survey work is required.\t\t\t\r\n- highway=residential General residential roads in a planned locality. Wide enough to carry slow moving residential traffic. \r\n- highway=service Generally for access to (or inside) a building, industrial estate, universities, parks, etc. \r\n- highway=pedestrian Roads that are almost exclusively used by pedestrians and are out of bounds of motor vehicles in normal conditions, such as plazas and squares.\t\t\r\n- highway=track Unpaved motorable tracks \r\n\r\nAlso, look out for pedestrian suspension bridges. They are common and [can look like this](https://twitter.com/pedrito1414/status/591976319153524738). Tag as: `bridge=suspension` /  `highway=footway` / `layer=1`\r\n\r\n** Buildings ** - Trace ALL individual buildings and tag it as `building=yes`.  For clusters of building, DO NOT enclose the whole area as one building.  It is important to trace individual structures for future damage analysis.\r\n\r\n** Residential/Settlement areas ** - For areas with a lot of individual buildings, enclose the area with a polygon - tag `landuse=residential` to indicate settlements.  This is important for getting an overview of the concentration of population/affected communities.  Buildings should be traced first before tracing the residential/settlement areas.\r\n\r\n** Waterways ** - Trace rivers and streams as lines, use the tag `waterway=river` or `stream`.\r\n\r\n** FOR VALIDATORS **\r\n\r\nMinimum data needed to validate/invalidate a tile/task are the following: \r\n\r\n* *roads* - validate if the major highways (primary, tertiary) connect to the residential areas.  Some settlements maybe isolated and the road leading to them may not be visible in the imagery.  If this is the case, no need to invalidate the task/tile.\r\n* *residential/settlement areas* - validate if all settlements (a cluster of 20 or so houses) are enclosed with `landuse=residential` polygon/enclosed way.\r\n* *major waterways* - validate if major waterways (`waterway=river)` was traced as a way/line.  No need to trace large rivers as polygons/closed way (`waterway=riverbank`), irrigation ditch/canals, or storm drains.\r\n\r\nFor more information about validating, [check this tutorial](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/OSM_Tasking_Manager/Validating_data).", "validated": 28.56, "name": " Nepal Earthquake, 2015, detailed mapping 2nd pass"}}
