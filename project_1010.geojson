This guide provides examples and explanations to consistently collect IDPs among various tasks.   \r\n\r\nAfter the main earthquake many buildings are damaged and weakened and can easily be collapsed by aftershocks.  For this reason, it is common for people to sleep outside in tent cities in open areas of the city (soccer fields, school yards, etc).\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this task is to map these tent city locations to help responders on the ground supply them with food, water, and medical care as needed.  It also helps assessment teams get a sense of how many people are in need of aid and have lost houses.\r\n\r\n**Example Bing imagery (Pre-EQ)**\r\n\r\n![bing](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8700/16678135213_f6e78c4393_n.jpg)\r\n\r\n**Example WorldView3 imagery traced with IDP camp (Post-EQ)**\r\n\r\n![wv3](https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8779/17298386435_271ac50ecb_n.jpg)", "license": null, "created": "2015-04-28T05:26:21Z", "changeset_comment": "#hotosm-project-1010", "per_task_instructions": "", "last_update": "2015-05-01T05:13:20Z", "priority": 1, "done": 99.72, "author": "maning", "short_description": "**Task recommended for JOSM users only**\r\nAn image from the DigitalGlobe satellite of the taken on the 27th.
