For each campsite you find, draw an area around the entire campsite and tag it with the following tags:\r\n\r\n* **idp:camp_site=spontaneous_camp**\r\n* **idp:status=new ** You need to choose between this value (new or increased or decreased or emtpy) \r\n* **check_date=2015-05-03**\r\n\r\n* **damage:event=nepal_earthquake_2015**\r\n* **source=Pleiades 2015-04-27, CNES, Airbus DS;GeoEye1 2015-05-03, DigitalGlobe**\r\n\r\nPLEASE reference the \r\n[Nepal Earthquake - IDP Collection Guidance](http://hotosm.github.io/tracing-guides/guide/Nepal.html#IDP Collection Guidance)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe best procedure to follow is to scan through the DigitalGlobe / Geoeye image to update the status of the  campsite, and then switch to the Pleiades to see if any change and determine its status. You can also use 2014-11-29 Pleiades image for comparison, whose URL for JOSM is:\r\ntms[23]:http://imagery.openstreetmap.fr/tms/1.0.0/kathmandu_pleiades_20141129/{zoom}/{x}/{y}\r\n(same license). \r\n\r\nYou can easily show or hide imagery layers in JOSM by pressing alt+NUMBER, where NUMBER is the number of the layer, starting with 1 at the bottom of the list and counting up from there, so alt+3 will show/hide the third layer from the bottom.", "validated": 0.0, "name": "Nepal Earthquake, 2015, IDP Camps in Kathmandu "}}
